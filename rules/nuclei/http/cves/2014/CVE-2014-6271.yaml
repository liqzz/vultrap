id: CVE-2014-6271
info:
  name: ShellShock - Remote Code Execution
  author: pentest_swissky,0xelkomy
  description: GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions
    in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute
    arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving
    the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in
    the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other
    situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary
    from Bash execution, aka ShellShock.
  severity: critical
  impact: 'Remote code execution can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and
    system compromise.

    '
  remediation: 'Apply the necessary patches and updates provided by the vendor to
    fix the vulnerability.
