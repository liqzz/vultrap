id: CVE-2015-3224
info:
  name: Ruby on Rails Web Console - Remote Code Execution
  author: pdteam
  description: Ruby on Rails Web Console before 2.1.3, as used with Ruby on Rails
    3.x and 4.x, does not properly restrict the use of X-Forwarded-For headers in
    determining a client's IP address, which allows remote attackers to bypass the
    whitelisted_ips protection mechanism via a crafted request to request.rb.
  severity: medium
  impact: 'Remote code execution can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and
    complete compromise of the affected system.

    '
  remediation: 'Upgrade to a patched version of Ruby on Rails or disable the Web Console
    feature.
