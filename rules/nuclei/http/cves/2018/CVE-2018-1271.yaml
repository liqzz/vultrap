id: CVE-2018-1271
info:
  name: Spring MVC Framework - Local File Inclusion
  author: hetroublemakr
  description: Spring MVC Framework versions 5.0 prior to 5.0.5 and versions 4.3 prior
    to 4.3.15 and older unsupported are vulnerable to local file inclusion because
    they allow applications to configure Spring MVC to serve static resources (e.g.
    CSS, JS, images). A malicious user can send a request using a specially crafted
    URL that can lead a directory traversal attack.
  severity: medium
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access
    or information disclosure.

    '
  remediation: 'Apply the latest security patches and updates provided by the Spring
    MVC Framework to mitigate this vulnerability.
