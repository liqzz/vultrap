id: CVE-2019-12985
info:
  name: Citrix SD-WAN Center - Remote Command Injection
  author: gy741
  description: 'Citrix SD-WAN Center is susceptible to remote command injection via
    the ping function in DiagnosticsController, which does not sufficiently validate
    or sanitize HTTP request parameter values used to construct a shell command. An
    attacker can trigger this vulnerability by routing traffic through the Collector
    controller and supplying a crafted value for ipAddress, pingCount, or packetSize,
    thereby potentially being able to obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or
    execute unauthorized operations.

    '
  severity: critical
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized
    access, data exfiltration, and potential compromise of the entire Citrix SD-WAN
    Center infrastructure.

    '
  remediation: 'Apply the necessary patches or updates provided by Citrix to mitigate
    this vulnerability.
