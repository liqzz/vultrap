id: CVE-2020-14413
info:
  name: NeDi 1.9C - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: pikpikcu
  description: NeDi 1.9C is vulnerable to cross-site scripting because of an incorrect
    implementation of sanitize() in inc/libmisc.php. This function attempts to escape
    the SCRIPT tag from user-controllable values, but can be easily bypassed, as demonstrated
    by an onerror attribute of an IMG element as a Devices-Config.php?sta= value.
  severity: medium
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim''s browser, leading
    to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.

    '
  remediation: 'Upgrade to a patched version of NeDi or apply the vendor-supplied
    patch to mitigate this vulnerability.
