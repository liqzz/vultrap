  author: mavericknerd
  description: Spring Cloud Config Server versions 2.2.x prior to 2.2.3, versions
    2.1.x prior to 2.1.9, and older unsupported versions allow applications to serve
    arbitrary configuration files through the spring-cloud-config-server module. A
    malicious user or attacker can send a request using a specially crafted URL that
    can lead to a local file inclusion attack.
  severity: high
  impact: 'An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files from
    the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access or sensitive information
    disclosure.

    '
  remediation: 'Upgrade to a patched version of Spring Cloud Config Server or apply
    the recommended security patches.
