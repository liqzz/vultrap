id: CVE-2021-21973
info:
  name: VMware vSphere - Server-Side Request Forgery
  author: pdteam
  description: VMware vSphere (HTML5) is susceptible to server-side request forgery
    due to improper validation of URLs in a vCenter Server plugin. An attacker with
    network access to port 443 can exploit this issue by sending a POST request to
    the plugin. This affects VMware vCenter Server (7.x before 7.0 U1c, 6.7 before
    6.7 U3l, and 6.5 before 6.5 U3n) and VMware Cloud Foundation (4.x before 4.2 and
    3.x before 3.10.1.2).
  severity: medium
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    send arbitrary requests from the vulnerable server, potentially leading to unauthorized
    access, data leakage, or further attacks.

    '
  remediation: 'Apply the necessary security patches or updates provided by VMware
    to mitigate this vulnerability.
