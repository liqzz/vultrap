id: CVE-2021-40978
info:
  name: MKdocs 1.2.2 - Directory Traversal
  author: pikpikcu
  description: The MKdocs 1.2.2 built-in dev-server allows directory traversal using
    the port 8000, enabling remote exploitation to obtain sensitive information. Note
    the vendor has disputed the vulnerability (see references) because the dev server
    must be used in an unsafe way (namely public) to have this vulnerability exploited.
  severity: high
  impact: 'An attacker can read or modify sensitive files on the server, potentially
    leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or system compromise.

    '
  remediation: 'Upgrade MKdocs to version 1.2.3 or later to fix the directory traversal
    vulnerability.

    '
