id: CVE-2021-41773
info:
  name: Apache 2.4.49 - Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution
  author: daffainfo,666asd
  description: 'A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache
    HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs
    to files outside the expected document root. If files outside of the document
    root are not protected by "require all denied" these requests can succeed. Additionally,
    this flaw could leak the source of interpreted files like CGI scripts. This issue
    is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and
    not earlier versions.

    '
  severity: high
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized
    access, data leakage, and remote code execution.

    '
  remediation: 'Upgrade Apache to version 2.4.50 or apply the relevant patch provided
    by the vendor.

    '
