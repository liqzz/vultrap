info:
  name: Apache 2.4.49/2.4.50 - Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution
  author: nvn1729,0xd0ff9,666asd
  description: 'A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache
    HTTP Server 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to
    map URLs to files outside the expected document root. If files outside of the
    document root are not protected by "require all denied" these requests can succeed.
    Additionally, this flaw could leak the source of interpreted files like CGI scripts.
    In certain configurations, for instance if mod_cgi is enabled, this flaw can lead
    to remote code execution. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and 2.4.50 and
    not earlier versions. Note - CVE-2021-42013 is due to an incomplete fix for the
    original vulnerability CVE-2021-41773.

    '
  severity: critical
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    execute arbitrary code and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

    '
  remediation: Upgrade to Apache HTTP Server 2.4.51 or later.
