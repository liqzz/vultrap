info:
  name: WordPress Master Elements <=8.0 - SQL Injection
  author: theamanrawat
  description: 'WordPress Master Elements plugin through 8.0 contains a SQL injection
    vulnerability. The plugin does not validate and escape the meta_ids parameter
    of its remove_post_meta_condition AJAX action, available to both unauthenticated
    and authenticated users, before using it in a SQL statement. An attacker can possibly
    obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized administrative
    operations in the context of the affected site.

    '
  severity: critical
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data
    leakage, or further compromise of the WordPress site.

    '
  remediation: 'Update to the latest version of WordPress Master Elements plugin (>=8.1)
    to mitigate the SQL Injection vulnerability.
