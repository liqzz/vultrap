  author: Akincibor
  description: 'WordPress CDI plugin prior to 5.1.9 contains a cross-site scripting
    vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting
    it back in the response of an AJAX action. An attacker can inject arbitrary script
    in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This
    can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch
    other attacks.

    '
  severity: medium
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim''s browser, leading
    to potential data theft or unauthorized actions.
