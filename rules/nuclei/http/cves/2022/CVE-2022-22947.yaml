info:
  name: Spring Cloud Gateway Code Injection
  author: pdteam
  description: Applications using Spring Cloud Gateway prior to 3.1.1+ and 3.0.7+
    are vulnerable to a code injection attack when the Gateway Actuator endpoint is
    enabled, exposed and unsecured. A remote attacker could make a maliciously crafted
    request that could allow arbitrary remote execution on the remote host.
  severity: critical
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to remote code
    execution, compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the
    affected system.

    '
  remediation: 'Apply the latest security patches provided by the vendor and ensure
    proper input validation to prevent code injection attacks.
