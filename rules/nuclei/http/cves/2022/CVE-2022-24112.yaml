id: CVE-2022-24112
info:
  name: Apache APISIX - Remote Code Execution
  author: Mr-xn
  description: A default configuration of Apache APISIX (with default API key) is
    vulnerable to remote code execution. An attacker can abuse the batch-requests
    plugin to send requests to bypass the IP restriction of Admin API. When the admin
    key was changed or the port of Admin API was changed to a port different from
    the data panel, the impact is lower. But there is still a risk to bypass the IP
    restriction of Apache APISIX's data panel. There is a check in the batch-requests
    plugin which overrides the client IP with its real remote IP. But due to a bug
    in the code, this check can be bypassed.
  severity: critical
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

    '
  remediation: Upgrade to 2.10.4 or 2.12.1. Or, explicitly configure the enabled plugins
    in `conf/config.yaml` and ensure `batch-requests` is disabled. (Or just comment
    out `batch-requests` in `conf/config-default.yaml`).
