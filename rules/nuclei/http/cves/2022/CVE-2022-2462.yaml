id: CVE-2022-2462
info:
  name: WordPress Transposh <=1.0.8.1 - Information Disclosure
  author: dwisiswant0
  description: 'WordPress Transposh plugin through is susceptible to information disclosure
    via the AJAX action tp_history, which is intended to return data about who has
    translated a text given by the token parameter. However, the plugin also returns
    the user''s login name as part of the user_login attribute.  If an anonymous user
    submits the translation, the user''s IP address is returned. An attacker can leak
    the WordPress username of translators and potentially execute other unauthorized
    operations.

    '
  severity: medium
  impact: 'An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain sensitive information
    from the target system.

    '
  remediation: 'Upgrade to the latest version of the WordPress Transposh plugin (>=1.0.8.2)
    to mitigate this vulnerability.
