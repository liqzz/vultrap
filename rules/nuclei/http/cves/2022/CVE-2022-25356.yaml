  name: Alt-n/MDaemon Security Gateway <=8.5.0 - XML Injection
  author: Akincibor
  description: 'Alt-n/MDaemon Security Gateway through 8.5.0 is susceptible to XML
    injection via SecurityGateway.dll?view=login. An attacker can inject an arbitrary
    XML argument by adding a new parameter in the HTTP request URL. As a result, the
    XML parser fails the validation process and discloses information such as protection
    used (2FA), admin email, and product registration keys.

    '
  severity: medium
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    inject malicious XML code, leading to various security risks such as information
    disclosure, privilege escalation.

    '
  remediation: 'Upgrade Alt-n/MDaemon Security Gateway to version 8.5.1 or later to
    mitigate this vulnerability.
