info:
  name: WordPress Essential Real Estate <3.9.6 - Authenticated Cross-Site Scripting
  author: r3Y3r53
  description: 'WordPress Essential Real Estate plugin before 3.9.6 contains an authenticated
    cross-site scripting vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize and escape some
    parameters, which can allow someone with a role as low as admin to inject arbitrary
    script in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site.
    This can allow theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and launch of
    other attacks.

    '
  severity: medium
  impact: 'An authenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website,
    potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or further attacks.

    '
  remediation: Fixed in version 3.9.6.
