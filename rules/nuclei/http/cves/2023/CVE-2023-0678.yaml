info:
  name: PHPIPAM <v1.5.1 - Missing Authorization
  author: princechaddha,ritikchaddha
  description: 'In phpIPAM 1.5.1, an unauthenticated user could download the list
    of high-usage IP subnets that contains sensitive information such as a subnet
    description, IP ranges, and usage rates via find_full_subnets.php endpoint. The
    bug lies in the fact that find_full_subnets.php does not verify if the user is
    authorized to access the data, and if the script was started from a command line.
