info:
  name: WordPress GN Publisher <1.5.6 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: r3Y3r53
  description: 'WordPress GN Publisher plugin before 1.5.6 is susceptible to cross-site
    scripting via the tab parameter due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. An attacker can inject arbitrary script in the browser of an unsuspecting
    user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal
    cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

    '
  severity: medium
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the execution
    of arbitrary script code in the context of the affected website, potentially allowing
    an attacker to steal sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.

    '
  remediation: Fixed in version 1.5.6.
