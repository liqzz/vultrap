    unauthorized resources. This does not affect Superset administrators who have
    changed the default value for SECRET_KEY config.
  severity: critical
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
