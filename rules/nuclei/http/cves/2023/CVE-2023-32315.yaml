id: CVE-2023-32315
info:
  name: Openfire Administration Console - Authentication Bypass
  author: vsh00t
  description: 'Openfire is an XMPP server licensed under the Open Source Apache License.
    Openfire''s administrative console, a web-based application, was found to be vulnerable
    to a path traversal attack via the setup environment. This permitted an unauthenticated
    user to use the unauthenticated Openfire Setup Environment in an already configured
    Openfire environment to access restricted pages in the Openfire Admin Console
    reserved for administrative users. This vulnerability affects all versions of
    Openfire that have been released since April 2015, starting with version 3.10.0.

    '
  severity: high
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    gain unauthorized access to the Openfire Administration Console.

    '
  remediation: 'The problem has been patched in Openfire release 4.7.5 and 4.6.8,
    and further improvements will be included in the yet-to-be released first version
    on the 4.8 branch (which is expected to be version 4.8.0). Users are advised to
    upgrade. If an Openfire upgrade isn’t available for a specific release, or isn’t
    quickly actionable, users may see the linked github advisory (GHSA-gw42-f939-fhvm)
    for mitigation advice.
