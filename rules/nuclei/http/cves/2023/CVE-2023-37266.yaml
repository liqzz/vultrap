info:
  name: CasaOS  < 0.4.4 - Authentication Bypass via Random JWT Token
  author: iamnoooob,DhiyaneshDK,pdresearch
  description: 'CasaOS is an open-source Personal Cloud system. Unauthenticated attackers
    can craft arbitrary JWTs and access features that usually require authentication
    and execute arbitrary commands as `root` on CasaOS instances. This problem was
    addressed by improving the validation of JWTs in commit `705bf1f`. This patch
    is part of CasaOS 0.4.4. Users should upgrade to CasaOS 0.4.4. If they can''t,
    they should temporarily restrict access to CasaOS to untrusted users, for instance
    by not exposing it publicly.

    '
  severity: critical
  impact: 'Successful exploitation allows unauthorized access to the CasaOS system.

    '
  remediation: The problem was addressed by improving the validation of JWTs in 705bf1f.
    This patch is part of CasaOS 0.4.4.
