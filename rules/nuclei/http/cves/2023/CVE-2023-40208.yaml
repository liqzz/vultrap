id: CVE-2023-40208
info:
  name: Stock Ticker <= 3.23.2 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: theamanrawat
  description: 'The Stock Ticker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting in the ajax_stockticker_load function in versions up to, and including,
    3.23.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such
    as clicking on a link.

    '
  severity: medium
  remediation: Fixed in version 3.23.3
