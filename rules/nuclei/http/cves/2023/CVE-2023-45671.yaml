id: CVE-2023-45671
info:
  name: Frigate < 0.13.0 Beta 3 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: ritikchaddha
  description: 'Frigate is an open source network video recorder. Before version 0.13.0
    Beta 3, there is a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in any API endpoints
    reliant on the `/<camera_name>` base path as values provided for the path are
    not sanitized. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to both know
    very specific information about a user''s Frigate server and requires an authenticated
    user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance.
    This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances:
    Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication); attacker
    knows the address of a user''s Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized
    page which links to the user''s Frigate instance; attacker finds a way to get
    an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link.
    As the reflected values included in the URL are not sanitized or escaped, this
    permits execution arbitrary Javascript payloads. Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains
    a patch for this issue.

    '
  severity: medium
  remediation: It has been fixed in version 0.13.0 Beta 3
