  description: Dell EMC ECOM default login information "(admin:#1Password)" was discovered.
  severity: high
  remediation: To resolve this issue, perform a "remsys" and "addsys" with no other
    operations occurring (reference the appropriate SMI-S provider documentation)
    and specify the new password when re-adding the array. If there are issues performing
    the "addsys" operation, it is recommended to restart the management server on
    each SP.
