  author: gy741
  description: Selea Targa IP OCR-ANPR camera suffers from an unauthenticated local
    file inclusion vulnerability because input passed through the Download Archive
    in Storage page using get_file.php script is not properly verified before being

    and sensitive files via directory traversal attacks and aid the attacker in disclosing
    clear-text credentials.
