  name: Detect DNS over HTTPS
  author: geeknik
  description: 'With DNS over HTTPS (DoH), DNS queries and responses are encrypted
    and sent via the HTTP or HTTP/2 protocols. DoH ensures that attackers cannot forge
    or alter DNS traffic. DoH uses port 443, which is the standard HTTPS traffic port,
    to wrap the DNS query in an HTTPS request. DNS queries and responses are camouflaged
    within other HTTPS traffic, since it all comes and goes from the same port.
