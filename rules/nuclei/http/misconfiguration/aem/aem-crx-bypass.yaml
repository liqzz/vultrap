  name: AEM Package Manager - Authentication Bypass
  author: dhiyaneshDK
  description: Adobe Experience Manager Package Manager is susceptible to a hard to
    exploit authentication bypass issue. This issue only potentially impacts AEM on-premise
    or AEM as a Managed Service if default security configurations are removed.
  severity: critical
  remediation: 'Adobe recommends AEM customers review access controls for the CRX
    package manager path: /etc/packages.'
