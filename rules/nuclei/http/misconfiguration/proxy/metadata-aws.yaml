  name: Amazon AWS Metadata Service Check
  author: sullo,DhiyaneshDk
  description: The host is configured as a proxy which allows access to the metadata
    provided by a cloud provider such as AWS or OVH. This could allow significant
    access to the host/infrastructure.
  severity: critical
  remediation: Disable the proxy or restrict configuration to only allow access to
    approved hosts/ports. Upgrade to IMDSv2 if possible.
