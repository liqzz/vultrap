  name: PUT Method Enabled
  author: xElkomy
  description: The HTTP PUT method is normally used to upload data that is saved on
    the server at a user-supplied URL. If enabled, an attacker may be able to place
    arbitrary, and potentially malicious, content into the application. Depending
    on the server's configuration, this may lead to compromise of other users (by
    uploading client-executable scripts), compromise of the server (by uploading server-executable
    code), or other attacks.
