  name: elFinder 2.1.58 - Remote Code Execution
  author: idealphase
  description: elFinder 2.1.58 is vulnerable to remote code execution. This can allow
    an attacker to execute arbitrary code and commands on the server hosting the elFinder
    PHP connector, even with minimal configuration.
  severity: critical
  remediation: The issues were patched in version 2.1.59. As a workaround, ensure
    the connector is not exposed without authentication.
