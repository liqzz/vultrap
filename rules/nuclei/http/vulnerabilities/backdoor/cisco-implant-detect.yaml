  description: 'Cisco is aware of active exploitation of a previously unknown vulnerability
    in the web UI feature of Cisco IOS XE Software when exposed to the internet or
    to untrusted networks. This vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker
    to create an account on an affected system with privilege level 15 access. The
    attacker can then use that account to gain control of the affected system.

    '
  severity: critical
  remediation: 'Disable the HTTP server feature on internet-facing systems by running
    one of the following commands in global configuration mode: ''no ip http server''
    or ''no ip http secure-server''.
