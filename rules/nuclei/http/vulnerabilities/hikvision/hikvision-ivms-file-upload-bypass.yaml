  name: Hikvison iVMS - File Upload Bypass
  author: SleepingBag945
  description: Hikvision iVMS integrated security system has a vulnerability that
    allows arbitrary file uploads. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by obtaining
    the encryption key to create a forged token. By using the forged token, they can
    make requests to the "/resourceOperations/upload" interface to upload files of
    their choice. This can lead to gaining unauthorized webshell access on the server,
    enabling remote execution of malicious code.
