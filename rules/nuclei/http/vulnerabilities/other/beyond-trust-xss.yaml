  description: 'Unauthenticated cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in BeyondTrust
    Secure Remote Access Base Software through 6.0.1 allow remote attackers to inject
    arbitrary web script or HTML. Remote attackers could acheive full admin access
    to the appliance, by tricking the administrator into creating a new admin account
    through an XSS/CSRF attack involving a crafted request to the /appliance/users?action=edit
    endpoint.
