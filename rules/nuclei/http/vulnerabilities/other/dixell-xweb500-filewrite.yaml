  name: Emerson Dixell XWEB-500 - Arbitrary File Write
  author: hackerarpan
  description: Emerson Dixell XWEB-500 products are affected by arbitrary file write
    vulnerabilities in /cgi-bin/logo_extra_upload.cgi, /cgi-bin/cal_save.cgi, and
    /cgi-bin/lo_utils.cgi. An attacker will be able to write any file on the target
    system without any kind of authentication mechanism, and this can lead to denial
    of service and potentially remote code execution. Note that this product has not
    been supported since 2018 and should be removed or replaced.
