  description: 'servlet called "CitiesServlet" that handles HTTP GET requests, so
    the user-provided input, obtained from the country parameter, is directly concatenated
    with the "/cities/cities_" string to form the fileName, This means an attacker
    can manipulate the country parameter and potentially access arbitrary files on
    the server''s file system
