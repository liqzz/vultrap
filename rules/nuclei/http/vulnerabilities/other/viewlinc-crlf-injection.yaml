  name: viewLinc 5.1.2.367 - Carriage Return Line Feed Attack
  author: geeknik
  description: viewLinc 5.1.2.367 (and sometimes 5.1.1.50) allows remote attackers
    to inject a carriage return line feed (CRLF) character into the responses returned
    by the product, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the
    response returned.
