  name: Xdebug remote code execution via xdebug.remote_connect_back
  author: pwnhxl
  description: 'The XDebug extension <= v2.6.0 for PHP is designed to expand the debugging
    capabilities of developers, including the ability to perform remote debugging.
    A misconfigured server, with ‘xdebug.remote_connect_back’ enabled, exposed to
    the internet could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger a debugging
    session using any IP via a simple web request. With a remote debugging session
    established, the attacker effectively has remote code execution (RCE) capabilities
    with which to establish persistence, exfiltrate data, or launch further attacks
    against the system or network.
