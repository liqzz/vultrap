  name: SquirrelMail Address Add 1.4.2 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: dhiyaneshDk
  description: SquirrelMail Address Add 1.4.2 plugin contains a cross-site scripting
    vulnerability. It fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, thus allowing
    an attacker to execute arbitrary script in the browser of an unsuspecting user
    in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based
    authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
