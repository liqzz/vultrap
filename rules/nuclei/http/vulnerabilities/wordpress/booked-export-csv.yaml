  name: Booked < 2.2.6 - Broken Authentication
  author: random-robbie
  description: 'The Booked plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass
    due to missing capability checks on several functions hooked via AJAX actions
    in versions up to, and including, 2.2.5. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with subscriber-level permissions and above to execute several unauthorized
    actions.

    '
  severity: high
  remediation: Fixed in version 2.2.6
