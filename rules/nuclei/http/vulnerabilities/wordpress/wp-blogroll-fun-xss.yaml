    Scripting
  author: DhiyaneshDK
  description: 'WordPress Plugin Blogroll Fun-Show Last Post and Last Update Time
    0.8.4 and possibly prior versions are prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability
    because of a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker may
    leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting
    user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal
    cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

    '
  severity: high
  remediation: Update to plugin version 0.8.5 or later.
