  name: WordPress REST API User Enumeration
  author: Manas_Harsh,daffainfo,geeknik,dr0pd34d
  description: 'The REST API exposed user data for all users who had authored a post
    of a public post type. WordPress 4.7.1 limits this to only post types which have
    specified that they should be shown within the REST API.

    '
  severity: low
  impact: 'An attacker can easily determine valid usernames, which can lead to targeted
    attacks such as brute force attacks or social engineering.

    '
  remediation: 'Install a WordPress plugin such as Stop User Enumeration. Stop User
    Enumeration is a security plugin designed to detect and prevent hackers scanning
    your site for user names.
